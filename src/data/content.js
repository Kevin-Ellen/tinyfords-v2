    <h2 class="a11y">Intro</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Tiny Fords. My name is Kevin Ellen, and I'm the creator of this website. I've been collecting Ford die-cast cars for years, and I created this website as a tool to keep track of my collection.</p>

    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>As my collection grew, I found myself buying duplicates and missing out on cars I wanted to add to my collection. I realized that I needed a way to easily and quickly navigate my collection online, so I wouldn't make these mistakes anymore. That's when I decided to create Tiny Fords.</p>

    <p>As my collection grew, I found myself buying duplicates and missing out on cars I wanted to add to my collection. I realized that I needed a way to easily and quickly navigate my collection online, so I wouldn't make these mistakes anymore. That's when I decided to create Tiny Fords.</p>

    <h2>Why Tiny Fords?</h2>
    <p>The website is a non-commercial site and it was created by me for myself, but I decided to share it with others as I thought we might be able to swap duplicates or identify cars I have not yet in my collection. With Tiny Fords, I can browse Hot Wheels, Matchbox, and other car models easily, and avoid buying duplicates.</p>

    <h2>What's next?</h2>
    <p>In the future, I plan to add more features and improvements to the website, such as a "Want List" page, where I can keep track of the cars I'm looking for. I also plan to keep the collection up-to-date with new additions.</p>

    <h2 class="a11y">Closing words</h2>
    <p>Thank you for visiting Tiny Fords. I hope you enjoy exploring my collection as much as I do. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to me via the <a href="/contact">contact page</a>.</p>
